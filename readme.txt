Verify site ownership on Google Search Console! Analyze the Google Search Console stats, to see your site's performance on Google Search.

== Description ==

### Google Search Console site verification

Search Engine Insights adds your website to Google Search Console and helps you verify site ownership:

- Detects your default WordPress Site URL and gives you the option to add it to Search Console. 
- Automatically insert Google Search Console metatag to verify site ownership.

### View Google Search Console stats on your WordPress dashboard

Search Engine Insights will help you understand your site's search engine traffic and performance, by displaying key stats in a widget, on your WordPress dashboard.

In addition to a set of general Search Console reports, per Page and Post statistics will allow further segmentation of your search engine data, providing search engine insights for your web pages.

#### Google Search Console stats on your admin dashboard

- Four reports with overview stats about Impressions, Clicks, Position and Click Through Rate 
- Location statistics with insights about your search engine performance by country   
- Page stats which will show you how your web pages are performing
- Keywords report useful for your keywords research and strategy on search engines

#### In-depth Google Search Console stats for your web pages

Individual reports for each web page on your site with per page details as:

- Impressions and Clicks stats
- Position and Click Through Rate reports
- Location, Pages, and Keywords statistics

In addition, you can control who can view specific search console reports by setting permissions based on user roles.
